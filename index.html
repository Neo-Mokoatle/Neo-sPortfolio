                    <h3>Project 1: IEC online voting system</h3>
                    <p>The Online Voting System aims to revolutionize the traditional voting process by introducing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly online platform for national elections. This system will provide a modern alternative to the pen-and-paper voting method, addressing issues such as manual vote counting, long queues, voter fraud, and the complexity of choosing from numerous candidates. By leveraging technology, the system seeks to enhance the electoral process's transparency, accuracy, and accessibility.
                        Objectives
                        *Modernization: Replace the traditional voting method with an advanced online platform.
                        *Efficiency: Streamline the voting process, reducing the time taken to cast and count votes.
                        *Security: Implement robust security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of votes.
                        *Accessibility: Make the voting process more accessible to all eligible voters, regardless of their physical location.
                        *Transparency: Provide real-time updates and clear, transparent results
                        The project encompasses the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the Online Voting System..</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Pet Addoption Agency</h3>
                    <p>This project involved developing a comprehensive solution for manag- ing a pet adoption system through the utilization of UML diagrams. Our team crafted an Activity Diagram to show all the step-by-step activities performed by the system, as well as all the entities involved, and a Use Case Diagram to depict the system’s exclusive activities. Next, our team proceeded with drawing a Detailed Domain Class Diagram that provides an in-depth visual representation of the various classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them within the specific domain and sys- tem, including a comprehensive view of the entities/classes relevant to the domain, along with their properties and connections. We finalized the project with an Interaction Sequence Diagram using software UML software, Lucidchart, Bizagi as well as Microsoft visio
